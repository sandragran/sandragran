# Projects

## Chlorophyll validation — Sentinel-3 OLCI vs In-situ
Goal: Compare satellite chlorophyll-a with coastal in-situ measurements. Includes NetCDF processing, matching in time and space, scatterplots and bias analysis.

## SST time-series & marine heatwave detection
Goal: Process Sentinel SST and in-situ temperature timeseries to detect anomalies.

(More projects / links to notebooks will be added.)
